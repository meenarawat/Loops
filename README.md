# Loops
In this repository I have use short codes to clear the loop function.
While loop
i = 1
while i in range (0,11):
    print ("Hello" , i)
    i = i+1
#2 Example
 i = 1
 while i<10:
     print(i**2)
     i=i+1
 #3 Example
Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is
stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.



#4 Example
Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using
a while loop.
